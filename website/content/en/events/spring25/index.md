summary: SPRING 2025. The SPRING graduate workshop is organised by the Security - Intrusion Detection and Response (SIDAR) specialist group and the Young Scientists' Advisory Board (JuWi) of the German Informatics Society (GI). Florian Idelberger Stephanie von Maltzan will present the work ‘Novel approach to protecting identity in a privacy-friendly way - approaching anonymity’.
abstract: 'The ultimate goal in data protection is often anonymity, as it facilitates compliance obligations, saves resources, makes data more accessible, and preemptively protects data. However, in light of ongoing technical development, actually reaching anonymity is increasingly difficult and is by some data protection experts even considered impossible. In this contribution, we explore to what degree current technical data protection measures can achieve the goal of anonymity. This exploration is based on our technical and legal research as part of the research project DROPS, which provides a platform to ingest, quasi-anonymize and analyse leaked identity data.'
